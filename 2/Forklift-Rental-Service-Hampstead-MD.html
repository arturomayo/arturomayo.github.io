The order selector operators ride up and down with the load and must be secured to the truck using a belt and tether system.</p>
<p>They are called as such because among all the other forklifts , they are able to reach heights more than its legs and it can operate even in harsh work environments. Choose machine category (petrol forklift, diesel, telescopic etc.), location, price range, manufacturer, production year and the seller, you want to buy the forklift from.
