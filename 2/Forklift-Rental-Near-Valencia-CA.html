That's why many pallet trucks are barely wider than a pallet. Don't buy high-end if they are looking for budget rentals. Cleaning Surfaces: Rough terrain forklifts are so versatile that they can even clean up after themselves.</p>
<p>You can set them up with work-saver forks (roughly about 9” wide), and they lift pallets some few inches from the ground. Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>
<p>However, they need training specific to rough terrain forklifts. Options and accessories available for this type of forklifts include a rail guidance, load-facing operator controls, a retractable tether, and an auto-locking pallet clamp.
