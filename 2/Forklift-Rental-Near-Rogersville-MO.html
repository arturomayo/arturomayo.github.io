<p>Caterpillar forklifts are notoriously powerful.

The innovative 3-phase motors in our electric forklifts combine powerful performance with minimal consumption of power.</p>
<p>Forklifts are designed and manufactured deliberately unbalanced. Typically the billing cycle for a forklift rental is monthly, but daily billing or weekly billing is available depending on the rental period and requirements of the renter.
