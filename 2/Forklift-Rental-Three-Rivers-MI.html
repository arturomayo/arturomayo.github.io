<h2>Fork Truck Safety Three Rivers</h2>
<p>Forklifts are powered industrial trucks used to lift and move materials in short distances. Operators get excellent visibility with panoramic views of rack, loads and aisle. Therefore, a truck's suspension has to be lifted and its components adjusted so everything fits and works well. This is an efficient way of picking less-than-pallet-load shipments and is popular for use in large distribution centers.</p>
<p>Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing. Prior to 2011 all States and Territories of Australia independently regulated occupational health and safety in that state, including forklift licensing.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of the rough terrain forklift is that it has more controllable cornering stability even in harsh environments.
