In England a 40-cell unit has been used to drive a forklift truck and to do electric welding. When you see a sharp increase in production demand or need to supplement your core fleet, forklift rentals provide a cost-effective solution to keep production moving.</p>

<p>If the operator must frequently enter and exit the forklift to access product, build pallets, etc. Ask what kind of lift it is, who installed it and if there have been any problems with it. Most lifted trucks are bought used so bring along a flash light and inspect the truck for crusted mud in the vehicle's nooks and crannies. Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>
<p>20. 20 Final Rule ï‚§ OSHA published the final rule for Powered Industrial Truck Operator Training on December 1, 1998.
