While it's true that safety officials (OSHA) are more likely to inspect large commercial jobsites than residential or multifamily ones, they will visit any site where incidents have occurred or where complaints have been made.

<p>The complexity of the operator controls, the caution with which trucks much be operated and the care required in moving heavy and sometimes precarious loads are all elements of risk with fork lift truck use.

The larger ground clearance allows you to install larger tires and perhaps the best part of all is that your truck will handle the same or better than it did before depending on the type of kit you install.
