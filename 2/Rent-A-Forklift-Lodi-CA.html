To be fair, suspension lift kits are necessary in certain scenarios Demanding off-road trails, especially when racing, require larger tires and increased suspension travel.</p>
<p>You can set them up with work-saver forks (roughly about 9” wide), and they lift pallets some few inches from the ground. Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>

Their decision to go with a Liftking product was in part due to the versatility of Liftking's robust rough-terrain forklift,” says Mark Aldrovandi, sales manager at Liftking. The most important things to know when you choose a forklift are its size, lift and load capacity, and configuration.</p>
<p>To be fair, lifted trucks are not for everyone, however, and there are some drawbacks that go along with their advantages. Furthermore, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that more than 540,000 forklift operators are employed across the country in all 50 states. Designed to work in narrow aisles, the electric reach stacker can tilt both forwards and backwards for safer load handling.</p>

One major difference between a forklift and a car is stability. That's why we invest heavily in keeping our rental fleet in optimum condition.
