<p>SCA Performance RAM trucks are some of the most powerful and performance-ready lifted trucks in the industry. This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life. However, the deaths of nearly 100 workers and 20,000 serious injuries that occur each year show that a forklift can be dangerous. Many advantages exist for using reach trucks. From reach forklifts to warehouse forklifts or rough terrain lifts - you can rely on our top-tier material handling equipment.</p>
<p>We sell, rent and service a wide variety of forklift makes and models. United Rentals deploys over $11.6 billion of fleet. The auto loan experts at our Dallas lease department will make absolutely sure you can get the best rates on any Chevrolet Silverado lifted truck. In 2000, OSHA issued an ergonomics standard.

Rental provides the means to obtain the latest technology improving operator satisfaction, WH&S and overall efficiencies.

If low clearances are an issue, CASE offers freelift masts that allow you to raise the forks 5 ft off the ground prior to the mast protruding, keeping your overall travel height lower.</p>
