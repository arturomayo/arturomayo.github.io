<p>Largely intended for safety during forward reach operation, they prevent rollovers by elevating the front tires off the ground and counterbalancing the extra weight. Their upfront price is the inverse of electric, making IC forklifts initially cheaper than electric models, but they cost more per hour to run. At Durante Rentals, we rent forklifts and telehandlers for all your material handling needs.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>We do extend special rates for longer term rentals. If your truck is lifted, or if you're getting ready to have a lift kit installed, make sure you're aware of all the potential safety and handling implications that are associated with the additional height and hardware. Rough terrain forklifts, as the name implies, are designed to run on rough, unpaved surfaces.</p>
