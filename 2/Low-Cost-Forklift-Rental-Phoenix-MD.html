A lifted truck has its suspension raised and may have its engine modified to be louder, creating a true white trash experience. Constructed with either internal combustion engines or electric motors, reach trucks come in three main types: straddle reach trucks, standup reach trucks or double deep reach trucks.</p>
<p>When ascending or descending grades in excess of 10 percent, loaded trucks shall be driven with the load upgrade.
