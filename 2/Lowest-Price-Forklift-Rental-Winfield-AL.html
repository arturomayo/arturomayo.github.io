An unimpeded view of loads and the surrounding area are a fundamental requirement for safe truck operation.</p>

Standard forklifts generally measure between 4 to 7 ft wide and 8 to 10 ft long. Knowing your required lift height is equally important and will affect your unit's load-carrying capacity.</p>
