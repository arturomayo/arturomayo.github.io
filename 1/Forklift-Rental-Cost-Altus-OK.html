If the employee was hired: The initial training and evaluation of that employee must be completed: Before December 1, 1999 By December 1, 1999 After December 1, 1999 Before the employee is assigned to operate a powered industrial truck.</p>

<p>We are a leading Manufacturer of pallet truck and pharmaceutical industry pallet truck from Chennai, India. More modern type uses a hand pumped hydraulic jack to lift. Since counterbalance forklifts are one of the most widely-used types of powered vehicles in the workplace, they fall under typical OSHA training guidelines.

They handle different sizes of loads and are engineered to perfection.</p>
