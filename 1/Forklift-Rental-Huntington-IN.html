<p>Quality parts for all lift trucks and all lift truck needs. If a truck is lifted for functional reasons and it actually functions better it's an improvement. Operate trucks equipped with attachments as partially loaded trucks when not handling a load.

If other tests or tests for trucks over 10,000 lb rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parries.</p>
