It is the highest capacity stockpicker in the line, handling heavy palletized loads at heights up to 366 inches.

This is why the aftermarket hardware can range from a minor lift kit to a comprehensive decked out vehicle.</p>
<p>In 1958, the first four-wheel drive rough terrain forklift was introduced. Once re-rated the forklift should have a new factory authorized specification plate, to replace the original plate, installed showing the new rating for the lift. The ITA says year-end lift truck sales totaled 260,180, with electric and internal combustion truck sales growing at similar rates (showing annual increases of 2.8% and 2.7%, respectively).</p>
