<p>Toyota Forklift is proud to have the biggest range of forklifts and battery-electric warehouse equipment available in South-Africa, ensuring that whatever your requirements we have a suitable material handling solution.

Generally, a lifted truck has the main frame and chassis raised up one or more feet above where it would normally sit on top of the tires. Be sure to find out what kind of warranty exists on the forklift. In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>

<p>For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test #OP1, of at full rearward till permitted by the truck mechanism at that elevation, whichever is less stable, Where tilt restrictions for various elevations are employed, and the rearward tilt position is determined to be less stable, the truck should be tested at maximum elevation for each tilt restriction permitted by the truck mechanism.</p>
