<p>Ziglift Material Handling is committed to your material handling needs and is open to service our essential business customers. There are so many things to consider when adding or replacing your used forklift equipment. Today, rough-terrain lifts have become the preferred forklift in agriculture. One of the key features of this type of forklift is that they are counterbalanced â€” meaning that the battery also functions as a counterweight for stability.

From lifting items into the shipping trucks to stocking things away in storage, their maneuverability lends well to various working environments and conditions.</p>
<p>What you need to do: Take a practical test where the forklift is driven around a suitable course and the operator will be required to move and stack various loads, the test will also include one to one verbal questioning.
