They can reach heights up to 390″ Orderpickers are typically powered by 24- or 36-volt industrial batteries. Shock absorbers manage the kinetic energy that travels through your Jeep's suspension and chassis as you drive to give you a bump-free ride and keep other components from wearing out too quickly.</p>
