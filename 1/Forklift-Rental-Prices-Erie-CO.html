<p>While the machine is designed to work on rough terrain, it isn't always set to work on all types of terrain. When you rent a forklift from Gregory Poole Lift Systems, you get the adaptability you need from your forklift fleet, without a huge impact on your bottom line.

<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>The 12,000 lb. electric is built on a larger frame than the 8,000 to 10,000 lb. trucks. Though pallet jacks are indeed very handy equipment to have around the warehouse, it's important to ensure that workers know how to operate them safely. The higher ground clearance will help your truck handle different types of road conditions.
