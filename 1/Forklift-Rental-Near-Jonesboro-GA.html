<p>116 Effective Powered Industrial Truck Operator Training Program Four major areas of concern must be addressed:  The general hazards that apply to the operation of all or most powered industrial trucks;  The hazards associated with the operation of particular types of trucks;  The hazards of workplaces generally; and,  The hazards of the particular workplace where the vehicle operates.</p>
<p>Top models are equipped with features that include robust transmissions geared for quick directional changes, custom tires that provide enhanced traction on loose, rocky terrain, and two- or four-wheel operation for safe, effective navigation. Rear steering makes it difficult to stop a forklift quickly or swerve and still maintain control.
