Rough terrain forklifts typically have rugged tyres and feature heavy-duty construction. For example, a hydraulic skate is not the same as a counterbalanced tricycle, although both are classified as forklifts.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>Moreover, it has a good hydraulic pump and wheels to help make this pallet very durable for long-lasting use.
