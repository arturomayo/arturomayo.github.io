Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>Shifting Supplies: Whether or not your supplies are palletized, you can shift them around with a rough terrain forklift. 158 Rule: The width of one tire will be the maximum distance from the edge of the truck while on any elevated dock, platform, freight car or truck.
