<p>In a stand-up forklift, most often they require the use of a joystick which can present a learning curve to some operators. Rough terrain forklifts have inflatable tires with thicker treads which allows it to gain stability on uneven surfaces. Some industrial reach forklift trucks have a mechanism allowing its cab to tilt, enabling the operator to have a more convenient position while viewing.</p>

The good news is you don't need to have any experience of driving a forklift truck to start learning with an accredited training provider.
