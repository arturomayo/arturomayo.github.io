An alternative to class 3s, tuggers can pull large loads without requiring the equipment to lift it off the ground to do it. This class is used on high traffic sites such as airport landing strips and luggage collection as they are easier to maneuver than a full forklift.</p>
<p>To be eligible for Modern's annual Top 20 lift truck suppliers ranking, companies must manufacture and sell lift trucks in at least one of the Industrial Truck Association's seven truck classes: electric motor rider; electric motor hand trucks; internal combustion engine; pneumatic tire; electric and internal combustion engine tow tractors; and rough terrain lift trucks.</p>
<p>Our exclusive ACR System (advanced AC motor control system) delivers industry-leading lift, lower and travel speeds and easy-to-use ergonomic controls enhance operator comfort for greater productivity. A lifted vehicle becomes naturally top heavy, which causes it to be sensitive while cornering and braking.
