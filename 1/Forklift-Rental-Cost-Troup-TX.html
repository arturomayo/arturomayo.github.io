These types of forklifts are designed to run on a variety of fuel types, the most common being liquid propane and diesel. When working in or walking through areas where powered industrial trucks are being used, especially forklifts, be mindful of traffic patterns and do not cross immediately in front of a moving forklift.</p>

We carry a huge selection of lift trucks and forklifts for rent to provide a fit no matter the size or scope of your application. Now you've seen how a forklift's center of gravity can shift.
