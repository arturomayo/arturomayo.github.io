The two forks on the front of the truck slide underneath palletised loads, to lift and transport safely.

<p>You must know how to safely load, unload, and drive a rough terrain forklift to prevent accidents and injuries.

<p>Pallet trucks should be durable, not disposable. More custom shops are toying around with lengthened trucks on custom chassis or even military truck chassis to create one-of-a-kind builds that get rubber-necked more than a 10-car pileup.
