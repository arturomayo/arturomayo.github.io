ProLift also oversees normal wear & tear” forklift service repairs. To be fair, suspension lift kits are necessary in certain scenarios Demanding off-road trails, especially when racing, require larger tires and increased suspension travel.</p>
<p>Crown's Smart Systems continually monitor and analyze lift truck activity to enable control of travel speed, braking, cornering speed and position hold. According to Manitou, cabs feature efficient heating and ventilation as standard, air conditioning (optional).” The company uses Shock Absorber Technology” designed to keeps the load stable in all types of terrain.</p>

Keep in mind that some trucks use struts on the front and shock absorbers on the rear.</p>
<p>A 4,000 lbs forklift with a 500 lbs clamp can only add 3,500 more lbs of items. The pallet jack is the little brother to the forklift Generally the heavier a pallet jack is, the more weight it can handle on its rated operating capacity.
